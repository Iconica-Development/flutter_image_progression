# Flutter Image Progression

This package allows you to overlay multiple images on top of eachother and show partial images based on a progression value. Complex effects can be achieved by using multiple images and setting the progression value to a value between 0 and 1. This is for instance useful for showing a progress bar or a loading animation.

Supports all Flutter platforms.
